## An Encounter with The Fluid Outside

![](additivism.jpg)

\#Additivism is a collaboration between artist and activist Morehshin Allahyari and writer/artist/academic Daniel Rourke. In March 2015 they released The 3D Additivist Manifesto: a call to push additive manufacturing technologies to their absolute limits and beyond, into the realm of the speculative, the provocative and the weird. They then issued a call for submissions for a radical ‘Cookbook‘of blueprints, designs, 3D print templates, and essays on the topics raised by their Manifesto including text and projects on environmental ethics, objects in movements for social and political change, the renewed contemporary significance of the artist manifesto by the likes of the Accelerationist and Xenofeminist movements, and the potential of radical intervention in contemporary technocapitalism.

A talk and Q&A session by Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke about The 3D Additivist Manifesto + The 3D Additivist Cookbook and the artist’s own research and practice in relationship to #Additivism, activism, and critical/poetic approaches to 3D printing.

## Additivism Workshop

- 11.05.16 // Day 1 // 11:00-13:00 // 14:00 - 16:30 
- 12.05.16 // Day 2 // 11:00-13:00 // 14:00 - 17:00 

During the workshop Allahyari and Rourke explain how 3D fabrication can be thought of as the critical framework of #Additivism: a movement that aims to disrupt material, social, computational, and metaphysical realities through provocation, collaboration, and ‘weird’ / science fiction thinking. #Additivism embraces the 3D printer in the same way that Donna Haraway embraced the figure of the cyborg in her influential text A Cyborg Manifesto (1983). By considering the 3D printer as a technology for remodelling thought into profound, and often nightmarish, new shapes, #Additivism aims to expose inbetweens, empower the powerless, and question the presupposed.  3D printing promises to become a widespread material language, allowing anything that can be stored as a digital template to be realised – just as long as one has the necessary materials. In The 3D Additivist Manifesto, Morehshin Allahyari and Daniel Rourke call creators and thinkers to action around this technology filled with hope and promise: the 3D printer. By considering 3D printing as a potential force for good, bad, or otherwise, they aim to disrupt binary thinking entirely, bringing together makers and thinkers invested in the idea of real, radical, change. Through their #Additivism project, Allahyari and Rourke set out to blur the boundaries between art, engineering, science fiction, and digital aesthetics with poetic, revolutionary gusto to forcefully question the contradictions of living under technocapitalism.

They explore the promises of Additivist technologies through the metaphors of crude oil, plastic and desertification, and talk about the Anthropocene and Chthulucene; about forms of embodiment, alterity, and activism still waiting to be unleashed through acts of material creativity. #Additivism calls for artists, activists, designers, scientists, and critical engineers to accelerate the 3D printer and other Additivist technologies to their absolute limits and beyond, into the realm of the speculative, the provocative and the weird.

To get into the Additivism mood, watch the Additivism Manifesto.
