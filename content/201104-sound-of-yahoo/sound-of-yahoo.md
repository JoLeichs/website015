Interactive sound generator, lo-fi retro synthesizer and loop sequencer controlled with yahoo search requests. The user is allowed to enter a search term to the console, the term is sent to Yahoo as search request. The complete response, the 10 most recent websites, with url, description and all meta informations deliver the basement data to generate a 16 beats long loop.

Three oscillators, a sine, a saw and a square plays parts of the response text as notes, using url or cache properties as effects or the relevance of the search term as speed value.

Realtime search latency provides an interesting behaviour.
