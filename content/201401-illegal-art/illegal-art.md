We identify legal norms in conflict with the right of free speech and/or the freedom of art and develop own projects that seem to be contrary to law or at least seem as such.

During the workshop we take a look at the boundaries between 
'Legal Art', Written Warnings & AGB and conceptual art, both theoretically and practically.
