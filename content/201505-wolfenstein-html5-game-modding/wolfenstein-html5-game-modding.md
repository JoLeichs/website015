## Workshop with JODI

![](wolfenstein-html5-game-modding.jpg)

The original Wolfenstein game was the first 1st person shooter in an open 3d game space.
From the beginning players were building tools to modify this game.
By the mid nineties, editors and tutorials could be downloaded from the internet.
DIY Game modification developed from simply adding more game maps to creating total conversions.
Since then Wolfenstein has been ported, deconstructed, simulated, hacked into many programming languages.
In the workshop we will use the latest rebuilt in HTML5 as a source for modifying this epic game.
