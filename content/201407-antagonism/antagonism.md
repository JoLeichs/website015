A signboard shows the aphorism “Do not explain overmuch“ by the spanish philosopher Baltasar Garcián in original language and translation.

This combination of generative art with a slice of philosophy questions the influence of interdigitations between aesthetics and (not) given context and indicates information, cognitive perception and their relation to each other as fundamental parts of communication.
