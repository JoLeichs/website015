Supreme Sunlight is a track from a.d.l.r.’s (Nicholas Morera) debut album “Foam on the waves of space-time”, released a few weeks ago on [Non Projects](http://nonprojects.net), Los Angeles.

I got asked by Atley G. Kasky, one of the curators from [but does it float](http://butdoesitfloat.com) and design director for Non Projects, to do a cover artwork for a tape. The complete thing evolved into a experimental glitch video achieved with [pixel sorting](http://kimasendorf.com/mountain-tour/)

The tape was limited to 100 copies and is sold out. But the binary version is still available on [iTunes](href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/foam-on-the-waves-of-space-time/id411598959).
