These work combines the technique of stop-motion-animation - which has proved itself since the late 19th century - with the capabilities of the new, interactive video formats. In so doing, the focus is on the interaction between animation and music. The original version of this work was programmed in 2007, using the application 'Processing'; further, it was on exposition multiple times.
