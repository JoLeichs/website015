The remote controlled rock band - an audio-/video-installation along with musicians from the improvisational band ‘Peter Pal’, which was shown on several exhibitions in 2008 - addresses the mainstream’s monotony and it’s dazzling of the consumer by continuously modifying the same schemes again and again. With the help of a remote control the user now is able to choose between 40 different audio and video loops and to create his individual variation of the program. Through repeatedly pausing or chopping the given loops he can break through their predictability and become more creative.

In cooperation with Timm Richter.
