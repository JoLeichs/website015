Adventures through the world of colours.

A Sheep’s Journey is for children. It’s here for them to learn the language of design and how to harness their incredibly hard working imaginations. A Sheep’s World is here to teach children the language of design. Working in close cooperation with Saskia Schmidt and their teachers, children will be given a workshop in which they create part of a film that involves building up a story from the theme right through to completing the animation. Each workshop is a new episode in the life of a little white sheep who has gone on an adventure to see every single colour in the world.
