The sculptural aesthetics of beautifully arranged food creations are easy to understand by everybody. But for us as artist, aggressive and unpicturesque served meals in public dining rooms offer much more inspiration than very special dishes of the molecular cuisine. At first glance it looks like incoherent mixed foodstuffs. But for Duodezimalsystem, this chaos is the guarantee of unmistakable expressiveness we like to have in our works.
