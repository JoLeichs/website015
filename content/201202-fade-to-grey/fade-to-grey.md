This simple animation is worth a thousand words: The viewer has the impression, that both, the black and the white area move towards the images edge. The truth of the matter is that both move towards the other 'color'. They are growing instead of shrinking. By overlaying each other, they build a new field: The grey area. This picture is build as a powerful metaphor, which reflects almost every interpersonal, political and social process.
