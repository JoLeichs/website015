„_Please read this carefully_“ is visualizing the mass of contracts, terms, conditions and further commitments we are agreeing to in an unconscious way, when we hit the well known ‚Accept‘ button during the installation process of our common software.

These special contracts are so called ‚EULA‘s (end-user license agree- ments). Highly controversial liabilities based on a „take it or leave it“ mentality. In most cases the user has to agree to those EULAs after purchasing the software.

Thereby the licensor creates an unequal situation not only by forcing the user to accept those contracts in order to use the software but also flooding him with an amount of juristic phrases that is not understandable anymore.
