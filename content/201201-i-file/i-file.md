Files are not regarded as human beings. Although their existence resembles our ones. Their life is defined by creation and deletion. Duodezimalsystem changes to a binary perspective and shows the world from the perspective of a file. With the end of the lifespan comes the cloud. Each being leaves its incarnation and reflects on its existence from a third, elevated perspective.
