<strong>Abstract TV.</strong>

If you brought colourful light to locations where you normally didnâ€™t find some, it is good! Cause light is a magnet, not only for insects. StadtlichterImWohnzimmer (CitylightsInLivingroom) experiments with the phenomenon how light wakes and draws attention.

In its structur the installation moves between an emotion-lamp and an electro-grafic. RGB-LEDs are installed in each of the nine fields, which them it is theoretic possible to display every light-colour. Five adjuster to control the colour and the programs makes it either to a toy, an abstract television with nine pixels.
