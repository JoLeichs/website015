## Archives in Virtual Environments

![](the-oculist-reason.jpg)

Lauren Moffatt (b. 1982) is an Australian artist working between video, performance and immersive technologies. Her works, often presented in multiple forms, explore contemporary subjectivity and connected bodies as well as the limits between virtual and physical worlds. Over a number of years she has developed a body of work pivoting on stereoscopic photography and video and informed by the history of cinema and broadcast technologies.

Lauren is interested in how the dimension of depth in moving image can be used as a storytelling device. Her works have been screened and exhibited most recently at Museum Dr. Guislain, SAVVY Contemporary, FACT Liverpool, the Werkleitz Festival and at the ZKM in Karlsruhe. Lauren completed her studies at the College of Fine Arts in Sydney, Paris VIII University and Le Fresnoy Studio National des Arts Contemporains. She currently lives and works in Berlin.
